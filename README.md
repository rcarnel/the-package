The Sprawl is humming with rumours and tension. An operation has gone wrong and in the aftermath a package, the objective of an espionage mission, is loose.

Retrieval operations are underway but there is a brief window in which a smart individual operator may be able to swoop in and take the prize.

You are one of those operators

## Creating an operator

Choose a look, describe it to the other players.

Choose an archetype, describe it to the other players.

Now pick a Mode, this is the natural way that your character behaves and gets things done.

Pick a Secondary Mode, this is how your character acts when the chips are down and things aren't going their way.

Describe your Modes to the other players.

At the start of the game your character is in trouble, name a group that they have fallen foul of and how the relationship got so messed up. Your character also has an urgent personal problem that won't wait.

Describe your problems to the other players.

Now finally name your character and recap them for the other players.

Take two Data Chips.

## The Sprawl

Collectively describe the megaopolis you live in. Each player should add a distinct part of the city, part of its aesthetic and its psycho-geography.

The city should have two to three problems it is struggling with before the game begins.

## The package

Decide collectively as a group what the package is rumoured to be.

Each character should have a strong investment in retrieving the package. The package should contain the promise to them of resolving some of the problems the character faces.

## Foils

The player on your left is your Foil. They will narrate the results of your characters actions. While their character is alive they are unlikely to allow your character to win the package.

Whenever you spend a Data Chip you give it to your Foil.

## Playing the game

Play starts with the personal that most recently bought something they didn't really need.

During your turn narrate a scene that contains your character, your character does not need to be the focus but they must be present. Bring in as many of the other characters as make sense.

Focus the scene on how the characters are: trying to retrieve the package; resolve the aftermath of any trouble  from previous scenes; stopping anyone else from retrieving the package.

Any player may introduce a new story element, fact or scene direction by spending a Data Chip.

Play the scene hard towards a conclusion that changes the story. When the moment of resolution comes roll the dice.

Any player may spend a Data Chip to add a detail or fact to a scene. Data Chips always goes to that player's Foil.

### Resolving situations

Whenever a character wants to try and act to change the world they must roll the dice.

By default you roll 2d6, for each Data Chip you spend you may roll another die, the Data Chip goes to your Foil.

Agree with the other players whether you were acting according to one of your Modes or not. If you were acting according to your Mode then use the Mode result table, otherwise use the default.

Choose only two of the dice you rolled to be the result. Sum them and compare them to the appropriate result table.

Ask your Foil to narrate the outcome of the roll.

Once the outcome is resolved you may choose to narrate a brief (few sentences) reaction.

### Default results

2 Failure and friends get hurt
3 Failure and things get worse
4 Failure and the character's problems become more acute
5 Failure but other people suffer harm
6 Success but it's a mess
7 Success but the character picks up new trouble
8 - 9 Success but with a cost
10 - 11 Success
12 Complete success

### Mode results

2 Failure and unrelated things get worse
3 Failure and the situation escalates
4 Failure and people turn their back on you
5 Partial success but things are destroyed
6 Success but people hate you for it
7 Success but things get worse for other people
8 Success but with a lot of drama and heat
9 - 10 Success and you buy yourself time
11-12 Complete success

## Dying and winning

The game is over when all the characters are dead or one of them has the package.

## Epilogues

Dead characters merely need a resting place.

Losing characters may narrate how their troubles catch up with them.

The character with the package narrates how they use the package to put off some of their troubles and enjoy a moment of respite from their troubles.

## Dead people

Your character is dead when their narrative can no longer sustain their injuries or continued existence. When your character dies, take four Data Chips.

If your character is dead, on your turn you may narrate a scene involving any of the living characters you choose.

## Influences

This game is a hack of [The Carcass](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/132578/The-Carcass-GMZero-RPG-4) that simplifies the central resolution mechanism and reuses the Drama Point system.

* Should some content changes cost more than one chip?
